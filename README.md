# DBM-Project
SQL/NoSQL Database Management Project


This is a long-form class project where we worked in both SQL and a No-SQL Database Management Server, MongoDB, to extract sales data, transform the relationships into a fully-functioning relational database, find key insights, and visualize/contextualize our findings.
